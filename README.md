# ⚡ SparkVolt

*Powering the Future. Sustainably. Fictionally.* 💅

Welcome to **SparkVolt™**, the gloriously fake yet undeniably fabulous tech brand of the future. This is NOT a real company, but you wouldn't know that just by looking at the website. SparkVolt is a fictional electrical startup created as a **creative UX/web design portfolio project** by Liam (a.k.a. the interdisciplinary chaos wizard behind this repository).
